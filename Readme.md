First do npm install

The control flow of the contracts are shown in the contract (DaksNFT) itself as comments

I used truffleHDWallet provider to connect to my metamask to deploy the contract to the ropsten network as you can see in the truffle.config file

I am also sending you the etherscan links here too (I also wrote it in the email itself):
